I am proposing to simplify the package names of packages
in the ::bobwya Overlay, which are based on the
OpenSUSE mozilla patchset. This would involve renaming:

  mail-client/thunderbird-kde-opensuse
  www-client/firefox-kde-opensuse
  
to:

  mail-client/thunderbird
  www-client/firefox

Leaving the +kde USE flag in place.

I plan to implement this mid-July 2018.
