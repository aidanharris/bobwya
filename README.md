### Customised Wine package set
These packages are based heavily on NP's hard work - packaging Wine in the main Gentoo Portage tree. Thanks for his hardwork on this!
Now Gentoo has the most awesome Wine support of any GNU/Linux distribution!

Customisations, on top of the stock Gentoo ebuilds for: ```app-emulation/wine:0```; include:
* customised winecfg - with clearer Wine/Wine Staging version information displayed.
* Supports all Wine releases - back to version 1.8. Includes custom Gentoo patch to provide: GStreamer 1.0 support - for these older versions of Wine.
* Supports all Wine releases - back to version 1.8. Additional patches to provide this support: ```wine-1.8-gnutls-3.5-compat.patch``` , ```wine-cups-2.2-cupsgetppd-build-fix.patch```.
* USE **+staging** supports live building against Wine Staging commits or branches.
* USE **+staging** supports live building against Wine commits or branches. In the event that Wine Staging is unsupported for the specified commit - a helper utility will walk the Wine and Wine Staging Git trees. This helper utility will determine (automatically) the closest (date/time based) Wine commit which supports the Wine Staging patchset.
* Supports Wine Release Candidate versions.

Customisations, on top of the stock Gentoo ebuilds for: ```app-emulation/wine-desktop-common```:
* installs oic_winlogo.ico globally - so ```app-emulation/wine[-staging|-vanilla]``` packages do not need to reference the ```wine-desktop-common.tar.gz``` tarball directly.

Customisations, on top of the stock Gentoo ebuilds for: ```app-emulation/wine-gecko```:
* Supports Wine Gecko beta versions.

Customisations, on top of the stock Gentoo ebuilds for: ```app-emulation/wine-staging:${PV}```; include:
* Customised winecfg - with clearer Wine Staging version information displayed.
* Supports all Wine releases - back to version 1.8. Includes custom Gentoo patch to provide: GStreamer 1.0 support - for these older versions of Wine.
* Supports all Wine releases - back to version 1.8. Additional patches to provide this support: ```wine-1.8-gnutls-3.5-compat.patch``` , ```wine-cups-2.2-cupsgetppd-build-fix.patch```.
* Supports live building against Wine Staging commits or branches.

Customisations, on top of the stock Gentoo package: ```app-eselect/eselect-wine```; include:
* Provides more detailed error messages.
* Supports more verbose output about operations.
* Handles multiple variants - for more eselect wine operations.
* Avoids using globbing for symbolic link validity tests.
* Features an unset option to allow detection and removal of hanging / orphaned symbolic links (associated with this module / not associated with any installed packages).
* Has a bundled manual page entry.

### Custom GL lib switcher implementation package set
These packages are masked and are NOT extensively tested (but I use them personally!) Loosely based off the Arch-Linux GL lib switcher.

	media-libs/mesa : OpenGL-like graphic library for Linux (patched version - to work with custom eselect-opengl switcher)

### Infinality Fonts package set

Package Set to provide updated Infinality Fonts (subpixel font rendering enhancements for freetype2 and associated packages). These four packages are designed to be used __in__ __conjunction__ with each other. The __media-libs/fontconfig-infinality__ package is in the main __Gentoo__ Portage tree.

	media-libs/fontconfig-infinality : Provides configuration to be used in conjunction with the freetype-infinality subpixel hinting.
	media-libs/fontconfig : A library for configuring and customizing font access - with updated infinality support.
	media-libs/fontconfig-ultimate : A set of font rendering and replacement rules for fontconfig-infinality.
	media-libs/freetype : A high-quality font engine - with updated infinality support.

See [Gentoo Wiki: Fontconfig (Infinality)](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Fontconfig#Infinality "Gentoo Wiki: Fontconfig (Infinality)").

See [Arch Wiki: Infinality](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality "Arch Wiki: Infinality").
